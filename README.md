# FinalProjectRL
Here are all the code files for my final project - two agents zero sum stochastic game

# Running instructions
1. Edit 'FinalProjectRL/configs/config.ini' (with interactive_mode=True the pygame window will pop with a visualization)
2. In 'FinalProjectRL/runnable_scripts/main.py', change the 'set_ups' variable for the required scenario (there are many examples there)
3. Run the program.

# Requirements:
1. pygame
2. pytorch
3. torchvision
4. PIL
